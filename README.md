# nvim-init
My minimalist neovim init file

### Install
1. [Vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
2. Clone into `~/.config/nvim/`
3. Check that init.vim is at `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`
4. Go into vim and type `:PlugInstall`

### Features (no particular order) 
- bats highlight (for cli tests)
- autocompletion (with lsp)
- real-time errors (with lsp)
- fzf for file switch
- relative line numbers
- remap of (esc) to (Â²) - it's bigger on my keyboard
